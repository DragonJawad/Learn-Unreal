# Learn Unreal
This repo aims to assist in the discoverability of Unreal Engine learning resources, covering everything from art to coding. Learning Unreal Engine alone as an indie or aspiring game developer can be extremely difficult. Hope this helps ease your journey somewhat and becomes a frequent place to both come back to as well as to occasionally help grow.

## FAQs

    <summary>What does this repo actually contain?</summary>

    At the moment, nothing too much. The goal is to be pretty thorough, but for now, this will be a place to add in various resources I run into over time as well as larger suggestions I end up running into.

    **tl;dr:** I need to come back and rewrite this question in the future

    <summary>I want to get into game development but have never done game dev before. Am I at the right place?</summary>

    I - Jawad - have two very very strong recommendations:
    
    1. Make the simplest game possible, all the way from scratch to full release. It's alright if you have a dream game, but there are so many complexities and aspects to a large game that you definitely want to start as small as possible then work your way up to larger projects. Start with a sample tutorial project, slap on a couple levels, add menus and such, and release it! You'll be very glad you did
    2. If you have 0 prior game dev experience, then I suggest starting out with Unity instead of Unreal. For Unity, there's an extremely diverse set of learning resources for Unity development- massive depth and breadth of community resources. In contrast, Unreal has a very high learning curve with a far more sparse set of learning resources (hence why this repo is being created). Thus, Unity is a great place to first cut your teeth in reducing the pain on creating games and then you can later switch to Unreal once you have at least some basic experience.

    *Disclaimer:*
    I started out with Unity years ago during my college freshman year before I had done any programming or the like at all (Software Engineer background) and thus I'm heavily biased towards starting out with Unity  first. Unreal has become both easier to use and easier to learn since then, but the learning curve is still pretty darn strict. However, perhaps this repo will grow to the point where it'll provide you with what you need to journey forth with Unreal immediately =)
