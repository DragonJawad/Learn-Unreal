# Learn Unreal
This repo aims to assist in the discoverability of Unreal Engine learning resources, covering everything from art to coding. Learning Unreal Engine alone as an indie or aspiring game developer can be extremely difficult and thus I hope this helps ease your journey somewhat.

TODO: Emphasize this is based on my journey and what I've run into. There are tons of resources out there so there's a lot missing here as well. However, focus here is to list out key channels and otherwise resources that would help the greatest on a category-by-category basis

TODO: Perhaps a section on how to find resources? Eg, search on Youtube then google (lotta text stuff out there)?

## FAQs

### Broad Questions
1. <details>
    <summary>What does this repo actually contain?</summary>

    At the moment, nothing too much. The goal is to be pretty thorough, but for now, this will be a place to add in various resources I run into over time as well as larger suggestions I end up running into.

    **tl;dr:** I need to come back and rewrite this question in the future

  </details>

2. <details>
    <summary>I want to get into game development but have never done game dev before. Am I at the right place?</summary>

    I - Jawad - have two very very strong recommendations:
    
    1. Make the simplest game possible, all the way from scratch to full release. It's alright if you have a dream game, but there are so many complexities and aspects to a large game that you definitely want to start as small as possible then work your way up to larger projects. Start with a sample tutorial project, slap on a couple levels, add menus and such, and release it! You'll be very glad you did
    2. If you have 0 prior game dev experience, then I suggest starting out with Unity instead of Unreal. For Unity, there's an extremely diverse set of learning resources for Unity development- massive depth and breadth of community resources. In contrast, Unreal has a very high learning curve with a far more sparse set of learning resources (hence why this repo is being created). Thus, Unity is a great place to first cut your teeth in reducing the pain on creating games and then you can later switch to Unreal once you have at least some basic experience.
    
    &nbsp;
    
    *Disclaimer:*
    I started out with Unity years ago during my college freshman year before I had done any programming or the like at all (Software Engineer background) and thus I'm heavily biased towards starting out with Unity  first. Unreal has become both easier to use and easier to learn since then, but the learning curve is still pretty darn strict. However, perhaps this repo will grow to the point where it'll provide you with what you need to journey forth with Unreal immediately =)

  <summary>Useful Starting Guides</summary>

  Listed in personal recommendation order to go through:
  1. [Excellent Single Vid Material Intro Vid w/ Realtime 3D NowYoshi](https://youtu.be/-B9k7WwHexQ). Sooo good, excellent efficient introduction for beginners which teaches a wide variety of common techniques as well
  2. [Unreal's Official Intro to Materials Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lngF4VVNER4&list=PLZlv_N0_O1gbQjgY0nDwZNYe_N8IcYWS-&index=1). A bit old but not outraded and goes through all key aspects of materials rather thoroughly
  3. [Particle Systems Intro Vid w/ Realtime 3D NowYoshi](https://youtu.be/WAnAZcMHt9w). Another pretty solid succinct intro tutorial, this time on particle systems and several common techniques related to them. Note that this is with the older Cascade particle systems so may not be entirely relevant for you.
  4. [Udemy Niagara VFX Course by Gabriel Aguiar](https://www.udemy.com/course/ue4-vfx-for-games-beginner-to-intermediate/). 
  5. TODO: More solid Niagara guides!
  
  Note that you can skip all Cascade related tutorials if you feel that understanding and modifying older particle systems is not relevant for you.
